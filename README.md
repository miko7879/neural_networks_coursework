# DSCI 789 (Neural Networks) Coursework
All code from my neural networks course at RIT. The first three programming assignments were on FFNNs, RNNs, and CNNs respectively and were written in Java. A large portion of code for these assignments was provided by the professors, our task was to fill in specific methods such as forward and backward propagation and other components to ensure that the assigned tests passed. The last assignment was written in python from scratch, leveraging the pytorch library to build a simple CNN.
